# Transmission System Simulation
Project which aimed to simulate a digital transmission system in a programming language of choice. The system covers encoding, modulation, noise and damping, demodulation and decoding processes. JFreeChart was used to draw plots of dependancy between BER(Bit Error Rate) and alpha(noise) or beta(damp) factors.

### Technologies
* Java 21
* JFreeChart 1.5.3

### Key Components
* **Encoding**: Hamming(7,4) error-correcting code
* **Modulation**: implements ASK, PSK and FSK techniques.
* **Noise and damping**: Simulating channel noise and signal damping
* **Demodulation**
* **Decoding**: Reverse Hamming decoding with error detection or correction
